# Nayaabkhanâ€™s dotfiles

This setup assumes that you're on **macOS** and use **Fish shell** on **iTerm2**.
Heavily insipred from the fantastic [mathiasbynens/dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) and [paulirish/dotfiles](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles).

- It is opinionated. So check the code before using it.
